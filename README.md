All the commits are made in order to highlight the way in which the application structure has been constructed using the Test Driven Development cycle:

> 1. Write a test first. See how it fails.
> 2. Write some code. Just enough to pass the failing test.
> 3. Refactor - Optimize your code and repeat.
